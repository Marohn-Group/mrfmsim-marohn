    The operation is very fast and does not require extra memory because it

    For a dataset with a shape of (6, 5, 4) with a window of 3 in the x direction,
    the resulting array shape is (4, 5, 4). The two parameters new are
    (4, 6, 5, 4), stride is (160, 160, 32, 8) if each element is 2 bytes

    3 elements in x direction::
        dataset_strided = strided_axis0(dataset, 3)
        dataset_strided.max(axis = 1)
