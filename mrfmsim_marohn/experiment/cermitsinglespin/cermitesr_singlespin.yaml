description: Simulates an MRFM experiment in the hangdown or SPAM geometry where a
    single electron spin is located directly below the tip. With a small
    tip, the motion of the cantilever is not negligible on the scale of the
    magnet tip and the tip sample separation. We evaluate the full
    expression for the change in cantilever frequency including the effect
    of the oscillating cantilever tip.
