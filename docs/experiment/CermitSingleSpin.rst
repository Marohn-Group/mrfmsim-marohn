CERMIT Single Spin
==================

Overview
--------

The experiments calculate the effective force on a cantilever from a single electron spin located directly below a magnet-tipped cantilever in the "hangdown" and SPAM geometries. 
There are two experiments in the collection: cantilever spin constant shift calculated using the Trapezoid rule ("CermitSingleSpinApprox"), and cantilever spring constant shift calculated directly using elliptic integrals ("CermitSingleSpin"). 
The exact solution only works for spin directly under a **spherical** magnet. The experiments are adopted from Section 3.5 of Eric Moore's dissertation. [#Moore2011Sep]_
